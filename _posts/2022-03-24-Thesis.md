For a GUC engineering student, there are 3 ways to do your bachelor project and write your thesis:

1. A GUC topic in Egypt
2. A GUC topic in Germany
3. A topic that you got from outside of the GUC 

## 1. A GUC topic in Egypt

The university offers a lot of topics under its Phd staff where you can take a topic from a long list with a doctor whether he is from the same department or from another one. You choose all the topics in the order you want and wait for the announcement of your topic. 

## 2. A GUC topic in Germany

The university contacts doctors at German universities and reserve some bachelor thesis positions under their supervision. The list of topics is around 30 to 40 topics. You can choose to take a thesis abroad.

If you are a high ranked student at your major you can get a scholarship to cover most of your travel and stay expenses there. This will be discussed in another point.

The universities examples are Ulm, Stuttgart, Munchen, Aachen, Lubeck, Berlin, Schmalkalden, etc.

## 3. Your own topic (Free mover)

You can contact a doctor from a university abroad and let him send you an invitation letter from his university to do your bechelor project there. You should contact many doctors and try to find contacts to get a topic there. The process and tips could be discussed in a separate post.
