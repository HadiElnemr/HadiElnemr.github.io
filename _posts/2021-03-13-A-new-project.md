Lately, I found about <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and became very excited to make my personal website. 
I found <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> which is somehow very connected to GitHub Pages and provides some themes that can help you 
with a blog and so on. I then found <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio">al-folio</a> theme made by 
<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mshediva/">Alshedivat</a> which is also an amazing theme as it is intended for academics and provides 
a page for blogs and is very organized and easy to use. Take a look at the theme 
<a href="https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/" target="_blank">here</a>.

I cloned the theme right away and started customizing by disabling the unneeded but great features and there we go, as simple as that. The posts in the blog come with a lot of features and additions that are really great, the posts can have 
- comments, 
- code snippets with highlights according to the language used, 
- images that can be organized in the way you want, 
- maths equations, 
- formats and links, 
- and much more.
 
Also you can connect your webpage to Google Analytics!
The theme can be used as a portfolio or as a <a href="/Hadi%20Elnemr%20Resume.pdf" target="_blank">cv</a> to access your public information by employers, events organizers and so on. Dark mode is also included in the theme. You can also change the colours in the theme using provided variables with suitable colours. The writing of posts and addition in projects section are easy and are made using a simple markdown with Liquid code. 

I intend to use this website as a 'portfolio' and blog. More additions are coming soon.
